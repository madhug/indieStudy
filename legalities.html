				<h5>Legal Entities</h5>
					<p>When setting up your company, it is important to setup a legal entity for the company, and not continue as a Sole Proprietorship. This makes sure that there is a legal buffer between what you own and what the company owns. If, for some reason, something goes wrong, the liability is in the company. That is the company would get sued and not you. So, you are protecting your personal savings etc. </p>

<p>The different Legal entities available are -</p>
<ul>
     <li>C Corp - This is for larger, more mature organizations, and requires a lot more strict policies and meetings. Also, these corporations are taxed twice - once as the company's earnings and then as the employee's earnings or salaries.</li>
     <li>S Corp - This is for smaller organizations and it is a lot more flexible in terms of policies. Also, the earnings are taxed only once - at the company level.</li>
     <li>LLC - This is the easiest form of legal entity that can be created for a startup. It is very similar to the S Corp. There are some differences in terminology - like shareholders are called members in LLC. The more investment the company gets, the more likely it is to be classified as a Corporation. 
It is advisable to consult a lawyer when there are more than one co-founders involved. </li>
</ul>
<h5>
Intellectual Property
</h5>
<ol>
<li>Patenting doesn't really help a startup with protecting IP as it is more reactive. Anyone can copy the patent, and then wait for the lawsuit - which would be rather distracting for the company
However, having patents shows an investor that this is unique and important. And if the company is big, it is better to have it than not to have it. </li>

<li>Copyright - Just needs a copyright symbol. It is for a tangible expression of an idea - not the idea itself. </li>

<li>Trademark is for the "mark" itself - TM is self made. R (registered) is more formal
Doesn't really matter at the initial stages of the startup</li>

<li>Trade secret - Just don't tell anyone - no registration or filing for patent is needed. </li>
</ol>

<h5>How to find a Lawyer?</h5>
<p>
Not all lawyers know how to work with startups - they charge the standard rate. Some lawyers treat working with startups as an investment, and give reduced prices in hopes of a better return if the company is successful... 
</p>

<h5>Terms of services and EULA</h5>
<p>You can define the license in any way based on geography, time frame, number of people using it. For example, an individual license can be given for a single person's use, but they can't sell it, or include it in their product. A redistribution license allows for others to use it in their own products and sell it. You can hire a lawyer to turn this into a document. 
However, an easier way to get a standard terms of service - if it is not too fancy or important - go to websites that provide a similar service, and piece together the policy from their policies. You can then get a lawyer to look at this policy, and it would be a lot cheaper than to get a lawyer to write the services from scratch.</p>
